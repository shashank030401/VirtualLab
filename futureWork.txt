In the upcomming weeks we aim to pace up our work and put the front end togeather, as the front end coded and all the specific routes are well handled 
we plan to move to the backend and connect the data base to have the user feed back stored. 

As we have only ample time to completely execute one technical experiment, but if we have some more time in our hand we will aim to add an 
technical blog to our website where students regestred under the electronincs department of the institute can come post something related to core ECE , job notifications etc,
which would further improve the connections of electronincs students, This Blog can surely be expanded and all the students regestred under this college will able to handle this blog

At the end we want this to be a fully functional virtual lab of this institute. If we get suffiecient time to and some more experiments in the near future we would certainly try and execute,
we hope that this virtual lab project will be an asset for this institute and we would be grateful to have contributed to our institutes progress.
